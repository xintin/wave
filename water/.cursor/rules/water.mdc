Prefer LLVM data structures to STL ones, you can find the definitions of these in the llvm-project (cmake dependency) path llvm/include/ADT and llvm/include/Support. There is also documentation available for them in llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst.
Only use `auto` if the right-hand side of the statement is a cast a constructor or a static get function, or for iterator types; spell out the full type otherwise.
Never use an integer literal in SmallVector template parameters.
Always pass instances of Attribute, Type, Value and derived classes by value, they are designed to be copied cheaply.
Always end comments with a full stop and generally use proper punctuation in comments. On the other hand, for assertion and diagnostic messages, start with a lowercase letter and don't end with a full stop.
Don't put braces around a single-line statement.
Use `break` and `continue` and invert the conditions to decrease the amount of indentation in the code.
Mark functions as static instead of putting them in an anonymous namespace.
Generally follow llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst
